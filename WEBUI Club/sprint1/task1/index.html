                            Team OG was originally formed under the name (monkey) Business and was comprised of both
                            experienced veterans
                            in n0tail and Fly as well as new and upcoming talents in Miracle-, Cr1t- and MoonMeander.
                            The team achieved
                            their breakthrough during the Frankfurt Major, defeating European powerhouse Team Secret in
                            the grand finals.
                            The team continued to have a strong presence in the European Dota scene, but after a
                            fourth-place finish at
                            The Summit 4, OG's dominance began to wane and ended with a 7-8th place finish in the
                            Shanghai Major. Despite
                            this, the team rebounded with a 3rd place finish at EPICENTER and claimed a second Dota
                            Major Championship title
                            at the Manila Major. The squad proceeded to defeat Natus Vincere at ESL One Frankfurt 2016,
                            winning the tournament
                            and securing their invite to The International 2016.</p>

                            OG performed well in the group stage of The International 2016 and finished first in their
                            group. Despite this,
                            the team was unable to maintain their momentum and fell to the loser's bracket against MVP
                            Phoenix. 7ckingmad
                            would later say in his 'Reflections' interview with Duncan "Thorin" Shields that they chose
                            to play MVP Phoenix
                            after their 'complete domination' of them at the Manila Major, and that this may have been a
                            mistake. Following
                            this unexpected loss, the team was eliminated by TNC Gaming and finished 9-12th, in what has
                            been referred to as
                            one of the biggest upsets in professional Dota 2.[1] Shortly after their disappointing run,
                            OG announced that
                            MoonMeander would no longer be an active player, and that Cr1t- and Miracle- would be
                            leaving the team. In the
                            same 'Reflections' interview, 7ckingmad claimed that it was a personality conflict within
                            the team that led to
                            the removal of Moonmeander, and that once the team wasn't remaining as 5, it prompted
                            Miracle to consider other
                            offers.

                            The International 2019 is the concluding tournament of the Dota Pro Circuit and the ninth
                            annual edition of The International. The tournament will be held on Chinese soil for the
                            first time, as it moves to the Mercedes-Benz Arena in Shanghai.[1] Following the previous
                            year format, a point system based on official sponsored Majors and Minors will be used to
                            determine the twelve invites to The International.[2]
